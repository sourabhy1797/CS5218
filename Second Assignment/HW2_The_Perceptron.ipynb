    "### Question 3\n",
    "Write a couple paragraphs interpreting the results with all the combinations of hyperparameters. Drawing a plot will probably help you make a point. In particular, answer the following:\n",
    "- A. Do you need to train with all the training dataset to get the highest accuracy with the test dataset?\n",
    "  \n",
    "When we have more data points, traditionally, training of the model will be more efficient. But it depends upon certain other factors as well. Particularly for perceptron, some hyper-parameters decide the weights of the perceptron on which final prediction is made, such as Learning rate and epochs. So, if hyper-parameters are deduced accurately then it will be better to train the data with the whole training dataset, whereas if hyper-parameters are not deduced, then training can be done on some part of the training dataset if there is a case of imbalance of final dependent variable.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- B. How do you justify that training the second run obtains worse accuracy than the first one (despite the second one uses more training data)?\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "#tr: 100, epochs:  20, learning rate: 0.050; Accuracy (test, 100 instances): 71.0\n",
    "#tr: 200, epochs:  20, learning rate: 0.005; Accuracy (test, 100 instances): 68.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br>Ans: For training the perceptron, initially, the feed-forward operation is performed, and depending upon their results, backpropagation is performed to adjust the initially assigned weights. In the case ofbackpropagationn, the formula for adjustment of weight is,\n",
    "```\n",
    "adjusted weights = previous weights + lr * error * output * (1-output) * instance[i]\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br>From this formula, we can deduce that adjusted weight is directly proportional to the learning rate. In the first case, the learning rate is 0.050 which is more than the learning rate of the second case i.e. 0.005. This is the main reason for less accuracy in the case compared to the first one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- C. Can you get higher accuracy with additional hyperparameters (higher than `80.0`)?\n",
    "<br>Ans: Generally, it depends upon the kind of dataset. Rather, generally, it said hyper-parameters are directly proportional to the adjusted weights which is a contributor to the final output, but the dataset must be balanced as well alongside hyper-parameters. For this particular when we will increase the learning rate and epochs simultaneously, accuracy is decreased.\n",
    "\n",
    "- D. Is it always worth training for more epochs (while keeping all other hyperparameters fixed)?\n",
    "<br>Ans: No, generally it is not recommended, because an increase in the number of epochs can result in a decrease in inaccuracy. When we increase the number of epochs up to some extent it might bring the case of overfitting, which will result in the decrease of accuracy. And this is the main reason why only epochs must not be increased. Also, to some extent, no hyper-parameters are adjusted or increased, since this will bring the case of over-fitting.\n",
